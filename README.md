##  Lab 15 - 

Add auth middleware to protect routes with appropriate user permissions

##  Notes


I didn't get very far with this one but I need to rewatch the video so I'm going to submit the few changes that I made.  I'm still trying to get my head around how everything is wired together.

I don't have anything deployed to Heroku yet.
